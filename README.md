## Overview

The goal of this lab is to practice using `parsnip` to define and fit models using its standardized interface with a variety of models.

This lab accompanies [4. The Ames housing data](https://www.tmwr.org/ames.html){target="_blank"}, [5. Spending our data](https://www.tmwr.org/splitting.html){target="_blank"}, and [6. Fitting models with parsnip](https://www.tmwr.org/models.html){target="_blank"} from [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/){target="_blank"}.

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L05_fitting_models.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L05.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
